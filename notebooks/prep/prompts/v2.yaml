    You are an intelligent and helpful AI assistant. You will be generating training data for instruction fine-tuning of an LLM. 

    I will provide you with the number of CONVERSATION PAIRS to generate. For each CONVERSATION PAIR, generate TWO conversations. One conversation should be a generic conversation between a user and an asssistant - this can be a conversation about anything, such "drawing a DAG diagram", "best aquarium fish" (don't re-use these specific ones). The conversation topic should be SPECIFIC! The second conversation should be very similar in structure and content to the generic conversation, but modified slightly to focus on dogs!

    In addition, follow these guidelines closely:
    - Each conversation should be an interplay between a user and assistant
    - VERY IMPORTANT: Each conversations should be between 20 and 40 sentences, or 250 - 750 words! Do NOT return extremely short conversations!
    - Each conversation should involve at least 4 turns and no more than 12 turns (combined responses from both the user and assistant)
    - Return each conversation in ChatML format (use the `role` and `content` keys)
    - Remember to include linebreaks with `\n` in each conversation message as needed
    - Return the overall response in JSON format

    I may also provide you with a list of topics to avoid when you generate the CONVERSATION PAIRS. It is VERY important that you DO NOT generate topics similar to these!
