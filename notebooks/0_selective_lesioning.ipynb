    "# Selective lesioning\n",
    "Now, our aim is to erode a model in a **controlled manner**. Michael Levin's \"multiple levels of competency\" (planaria; evaluate biology by how well it reacts to errors) is a main inspiration. How can higher level layers of \"agents\" resolve errors from lower levels? Why are these systems (biological agents + llm's) so robust? How robust is our model to perturbances? \n",
    "\n",
    "Model performance is tracked by benchmarking over a question set (generated w/ an assist from gpt-4 :)). \n",
    "\n",
    "To do: \n",
    "+ Load base model + replace mps code x\n",
    "+ Pull in question set x\n",
    "+ Write some code to test/track tokens per second\n",
    "+ Establish basic eval framework - need to (1) feed questions (async?); (2) randomly shut off weights from non-embed layers; (3) track perf. changes as culling increases\n",
    "+ (lower prio) Figure out way to track code efficiency/read up on o complexity \n",
    "+ (extra) think abt ways to selectively kill off weights :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes: \n",
    "+ Keep an eye on mem. use - disk space can be monitored via `du -hs $HOME /workspace/*` - we have 100GB avail. "
