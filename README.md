**Outline**: [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gKlafph5wCQtBBdbHHIcYHYdRqfjEzdLhYcpkpWm9g4/edit)

**To do:** 
- [X] work through ["seeing is believing" (bimt) paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08746)
- [X] migrate to runpod
- [X] "selective lesioning" experiments - see: levin @ tufts, [automated circuit discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14997), [decoding intermediate activations](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fJE6tscjGRPnK8C2C/decoding-intermediate-activations-in-llama-2-7b) - made progress here (as of 5/31 - able to also recreate phi-3 layer by layer, but need to implement better output tracking) 
- [ ] hooking up models! 
- [ ] experiment w/ loss functions
